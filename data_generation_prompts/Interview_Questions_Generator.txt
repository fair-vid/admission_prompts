I have attached a file containing university interview questions organized by study program. Please analyze this file and generate a new dataset in TSV (tab-separated values) format with the following specifications:

Create a TSV file with exactly three columns:

Study Program - Use the EXACT program names from the attached file
Question - Generate NEW, original interview questions (similar in style and purpose but NOT identical to the ones in the file)
Time (seconds) - Assign a realistic time limit for answering each question (typically 30-180 seconds)

Requirements:

Include ALL study programs from the attached file
For each program, generate AT LEAST TWICE the number of questions that appear in the original file
Questions should be original and unique - do not copy or closely paraphrase existing questions
Maintain similar question types: motivation, background, technical knowledge, research interests, career goals, personal qualities, situational scenarios
Time allocations should reflect question complexity (simple factual: 30-60s, reflective: 60-120s, complex technical/situational: 90-180s)
Use proper TSV formatting with tabs separating columns
Include header row: Study_Program	Question	Time
