Based on this information, estimate the student's probability (from 0 to 100%) of being accepted **for a scholarship** at universities of three different global ranking levels:

1. **Top 10** global university
2. **Around rank 100**
3. **Around rank 500**

For each category, provide:
- A numerical **probability** (integer 0–100)
- A short list of **reasons** (2–3 concise bullet points) explaining your evaluation.

Respond **only** with a valid JSON object in this exact format:

{{
  "top_10_university": {{
    "probability": <number>,
    "reasons": ["reason 1", "reason 2", "reason 3"]
  }},
  "rank_100_university": {{
    "probability": <number>,
    "reasons": ["reason 1", "reason 2", "reason 3"]
  }},
  "rank_500_university": {{
    "probability": <number>,
    "reasons": ["reason 1", "reason 2", "reason 3"]
  }}
}}
